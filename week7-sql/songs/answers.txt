SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
0.71646
SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs;
0.65906
SELECT AVG(valence) FROM songs;
0.484443

Answer: Highest in danceability so 'Purple' based on my understanding on the article.
Answer: It is only based on the highest attribute of the three mentioned,
        a better solution would be by having an algorithm that includes the other attributes
        like 'loudness', 'speechiness' and 'tempo' as well.
