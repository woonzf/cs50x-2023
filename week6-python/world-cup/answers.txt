Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Small number of simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

1000 simulations seems to be the best in terms of time and accuracy
